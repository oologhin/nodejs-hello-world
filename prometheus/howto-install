                You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

                    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

                to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

                    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/serve_hostname
                */

**To verify if the prom StatefulSet has equal DESIRED and CURRENT number replicas, run the 

    oc get statefulset -n prometheus-project 

**To check all resources in the project, run the 

    oc get all -n prometheus-project command.

oc process -f prometheus-sdrole.yml | oc apply -f - -n app-project1
oc process -f prometheus-sdrole.yml | oc apply -f - -n app-project2
oc process -f prometheus-sdrole.yml | oc apply -f - -n prometheus-project

**To verify that Role and RoleBinding were created correctly, run the oc get role and oc get rolebinding commands.
